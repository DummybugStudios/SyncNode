# SyncNode
A collaborative music experience

## Features
* still massively in dev
* doesn't do anythign useful
* Stay away from this project for now
* I'm still learning how the hell javascript works so this is horrible

## Installing

Easier install instructions will come your way once I figure out what the hell I'm doing 
At the moment these are for development purposes and you will have to install nodejs

### Client
* Open a terminal in the **app** folder
* run `npm install` to install dependencies  
* To run the client run `npm start`

### Server
* Open a terminal in the **server** folder
* Run `node install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the server
